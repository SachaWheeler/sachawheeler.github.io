author: Geoffrey Dennis
rating: 5
summary: A self-published book from 1930 enumerating the various ways the world might end.
review: This is my favourite literary discovery. I found it in a library in Albuquerque, New Mexico
    in 1993 and have since scoured second-hand shops and libarries for copies. I have 12
    and give them to people who I really, really like. In a sad epilogue, Dennis wrote a
    second edition after the second world war, updated to included nuclear armageddon.
