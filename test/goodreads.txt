    <book_description><![CDATA[Romy Hall is at the start of two consecutive life sentences, plus six years, at Stanville Womenâ€™s Correctional Facility. Outside is the world from which she has been permanently severed: the San Francisco of her youth, changed almost beyond recognition. The Mars Room strip club where she once gave lap dances for a living. And her seven-year-old son, Jackson, now in the care of Romyâ€™s estranged mother. <br /><br />Inside is a new reality to adapt to: thousands of women hustling for the bare essentials needed to survive. The deadpan absurdities of institutional living, which Kushner details with humour and precision. Daily acts of violence by guards and prisoners alike. Allegiances formed over liquor brewed in socks, and stories shared through sewage pipes. <br /><br />Romy sees the future stretch out ahead of her in a long, unwavering line â€“ until news from outside brings a ferocious urgency to her existence, challenging her to escape her own destiny and culminating in a climax of almost unbearable intensity. Through Romy â€“ and through a cast of astonishing characters populating The Mars Room â€“ Rachel Kushner presents not just a bold and unsentimental panorama of life on the margins of contemporary America, but an excoriating attack on the prison-industrial complex.]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[<i>Macbett</i> had its first American production at the acclaimed School of Drama of Yale University. Mel Gussow, drama critic for <i>The New York Times</i>, wrote: "... Ionesco has written a comedy of monarchy. Viewed from the perspective of today, he sees <i>Macbeth </i> as a grotesque joke. How else can you explain mass murder? The message is deadly serious and even moralistic - Shakespeare and Ionesco are each studying the corruptive effect of ambition - but this is, first of all, a very funny play. <br />"'History is full of tricks,' says Macbett - and so is Ionesco. He maliciously undermines his source and its traditions, spoofing Shakespeare along with tragedy. There is always an extra ghost up Ionesco's sleeve. He is a grave robber, subverting solemnity and substituting antic wit and dry acerbity...<br />"For all his playfulness, Ionesco is very much concerned with the nature of revolution. As Macbett says, regretting his life: ' man doesn't rule events. Events rule him.' Kings rise and are toppled, and what do intentions matter? As Ionesco sees it, all rule is misrule, and, as for the rabble, they are scheming and hypocritical. The play levitates with humor, but it's heart is pessimistic... The dialogue, far removed from Shakespeare, is colloquial and deceptively casual, understanding the enormity of the events...<br />"As for the collaboration between Shakespeare and Ionesco, just as Shakespeare had his <i>Holinshed's Chronicles</i>, so Ionesco has his Shakespeare. Inspired by the myth of <i>Macbeth</i>, he has written a comedy with special meaning for today."]]></book_description>

One day she walks out of her office, acquires a gaudy new outfit, adopts a girlier tone of voice, and heads to the airport to fly south. On the plane she takes a seat between two men. One is delighted with her company, the other is deeply perturbed. So begins an unnerving journey into the darker recesses of human nature.]]></book_description>

She is passionate in the application of her unorthodox teaching methods and strives to bring out the best in each one of her students.

    <book_description><![CDATA[<b>The hilarious and wildly popular instagram comic about a world with no men</b><br /><br />With her startling humor, itâ€™s no surprise that Aminder Dhaliwalâ€™s web comic <i>Woman World</i> has a devoted audience of more than 150,000 readers, updated biweekly with each installment earning an average of 25,000 likes. Now, readers everywhere will delight in the print edition as Dhaliwal seamlessly incorporates feminist philosophical concerns into a series of perfectly-paced strips that skewer perceived notions of femininity and contemporary cultural icons. D+Qâ€™s edition of <i>Woman World</i> will include new and previously unpublished material.<br /><br />When a birth defect wipes out the planetâ€™s entire population of men, <i>Woman World</i> rises out of societyâ€™s ashes. Dhaliwalâ€™s infectiously funny instagram comic follows the rebuilding process, tracking a group of women who have rallied together under the flag of â€œBeyonceâ€™s Thighs.â€ Only Grandma remembers the distant past, a civilization of segway-riding mall cops, Blockbuster movie rental shops, and â€œThatâ€™s What She Saidâ€ jokes. For the most part, <i>Woman World</i>â€™s residents are focused on their struggles with unrequited love and anxiety, not to mention that whole â€œsurvival of humanityâ€ thing.<br /><br /><i>Woman World</i> is an uproarious and insightful graphic novel from a very talented and funny new voice.]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[A collection of highly imaginative short pieces that speak to our times with deadly accuracy.<br />A recently widowed fantasy writer is guided through a stormy winter evening by the voice of her late husband. An elderly lady with Charles Bonnet syndrome comes to terms with the little people she keeps seeing, while a newly formed populist group gathers to burn down her retirement residence. A woman born with a genetic abnormality is mistaken for a vampire, and a crime committed long ago is revenged in the Arctic via a 1.9 billion-year-old stromatolite.<br /><br />In these nine tales, Margaret Atwood ventures into the shadowland earlier explored by fabulists and concoctors of dark yarns such as Robert Louis Stevenson, Daphne du Maurier and Arthur Conan Doyle - and also by herself, in her award-winning novel Alias Grace. In Stone Mattress, Margaret Atwood is at the top of her darkly humorous and seriously playful game.]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[These three great plays by one of the founding fathers of the theatre of the absurd, are alive and kicking with tragedy and humour, bleakness and farce. In Rhinoceros we are shown the innate brutality of people as everyone, except for Berenger, turn into clumsy, unthinking rhinoceroses. The Chairs depicts the futile struggle of two old people to convey the meaning of life to the rest of humanity, while The Lesson is a chilling, but anarchically funny drama of verbal domination. In these three 'antiplays' dream, nonsense and fantasy combine to create an unsettling, bizarre view of society.]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[Douglas Hofstadter's book is concerned directly with the nature of â€œmapsâ€ or links between formal systems. However, according to Hofstadter, the formal system that underlies all mental activity transcends the system that supports it. If life can grow out of the formal chemical substrate of the cell, if consciousness can emerge out of a formal system of firing neurons, then so too will computers attain human intelligence. GÃ¶del, Escher, Bach is a wonderful exploration of fascinating ideas at the heart of cognitive science: meaning, reduction, recursion, and much more.]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[Dizzyingly brilliant, raucously funny, and painfully honest, GONE WITH THE MIND is the story of Mark Leyner's life, told as only Mark Leyner can tell it. In this utterly unconventional novel-or is it a memoir?-Leyner gives a reading in the food court of a New Jersey shopping mall. The "audience" consists of Mark's mother and some stray Panda Express employees, who ask a handful of questions. The action takes place entirely at the food court, but the territory covered in these pages has no bounds.<br /><br />A joyride of autobiography, cultural critique, DIY philosophy, biopolitics, video games, demagoguery, and the most intimate confessions, GONE WITH THE MIND is both a soulful reckoning with mortality and the tender story of the relationship between a complicated mother and an even more complicated son.<br /><br />At once nostalgic and acidic, deeply humane and completely surreal, GONE WITH THE MIND<i> </i>is a work of pure, hilarious genius.<br /><br />"The blazingly inventive fictional autobiography of Mark Leyner, one of America's "rare, true original voices" (Gary Shteyngart).]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[Bringing into harsh focus the daily struggle for existence in a Soviet <i>gulag</i>, Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn's <i>One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich</i> is translated by Ralph Parker in Penguin Modern Classics.<br /><br />This brutal, shattering glimpse of the fate of millions of Russians under Stalin shook Russia and shocked the world when it first appeared. Discover the importance of a piece of bread or an extra bowl of soup, the incredible luxury of a book, the ingenious possibilities of a nail, a piece of string or a single match in a world where survival is all. Here safety, warmth and food are the first objectives. Reading it, you enter a world of incarceration, brutality, hard manual labour and freezing cold - and participate in the struggle of men to survive both the terrible rigours of nature and the inhumanity of the system that defines their conditions of life.<br /><br />Though twice-decorated for his service at the front during the Second World War, Aleksandr Isayevich Solzhenitsyn (1918-2008) was arrested in 1945 for making derogatory remarks about Stalin, and sent to a series of brutal Soviet labour camps in the Arctic Circle, where he remained for eight years. Released after Stalin's death, he worked as a teacher, publishing his novel <i>One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich</i> with the approval of Nikita Khrushchev in 1962, to huge success. His 1967 novel <i>Cancer Ward,</i> as well as his magnum opus <i>The Gulag Archipelago</i>, were not as well-received by Soviet authorities, and not long after being awarded the Nobel Prize for literature in 1970, Solzhenitsyn was deported from the USSR. In 1994, after twenty years in exile, Solzhenitsyn made his long-awaited return to Russia.<br /><br />If you enjoyed <i>One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich</i>, you might also like Yevgeny Zamyatin's <i>We</i>, available in Penguin Classics.<br /><br />'It is a blow struck for human freedom all over the world ... and it is gloriously readable'<br /><i>Sunday Times</i>]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[â€˜Itâ€™s got a thunderstorm in it. And revenge. Definitely revenge.â€™<br /><br />Felix is at the top of his game as Artistic Director of the Makeshiweg Theatre Festival. His productions have amazed and confounded. Now heâ€™s staging a <i>Tempest</i> like no other: not only will it boost his reputation, it will heal emotional wounds.<br /><br />Or that was the plan. Instead, after an act of unforeseen treachery, Felix is living in exile in a backwoods hovel, haunted by memories of his beloved lost daughter, Miranda. And also brewing revenge.<br /><br />After twelve years, revenge finally arrives in the shape of a theatre course at a nearby prison. Here, Felix and his inmate actors will put on his <i>Tempest </i>and snare the traitors who destroyed him. Itâ€™s magic! But will it remake Felix as his enemies fall?<br /><br />Margaret Atwoodâ€™s novel take on Shakespeareâ€™s play of enchantment, revenge and second chances leads us on an interactive, illusion-ridden journey filled with new surprises and wonders of its own.]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[After I had shot the Underground images during the mid 1990â€²s, I set my sights on a project about London that was based on street level. For a few years I started a number of unconvincing stabs at this, but never really figured out exactly what would have worked, as London was too large a city to really do justice over a set of 60 or so pictures. Then in 2001, I realized the West End was usually my first port of call to take pictures, and the phrase â€˜up westâ€™ came to mind and a project was born. Over 12 years I wandered the busy shopping areas of Oxford Street and Covent Garden, drank in almost every pub in Soho, and stumbled across dozens of demonstrations, events, street parties and cultural festivals. Along with all the other usual comings and goings, I finally managed to put these pictures together into something I hope will make sense.<br /><br />Introduction by David Gibson]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[<p>This book challenges those who argue that we can change the world by changing the way people think. The author shows that no matter how bizarre a people's behavior may seem, it always stems from concrete social and economic conditions. It is by isolating and identifying these conditions that we will be able to understand and cope with some of our own apparently senseless life styles. In a devastating attack on the shamans of the counterculture, the author states the case for a return to objective consciousness and a rational set of political commitments.</p>]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[Calculus for Cats describes the processes, vocabulary and strategies of calculus for people who like to learn the concepts of a subject before they start trying to operate it. In an irreverent tone, it explains what calculus is, why it's important, what the procedures are and when to use them. Many people learn subjects like calculus by repeating the procedures but sometimes feel like they don't really understand what's going on. This book answers their questions. Over the last decade of the book's existence, the most common comment it's received is, "Wow! So that's how it works! I wish I had this book back when i took the course." Obviously, it's even more valuable to students before they take the course. It contains no exercises; it won't replace a standard text or teacher. What it does is provide a second explanation of what's going on that many people find useful, and everyone agrees is much different from the traditional approaches.]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[It's the story "They" don't want you to read. Though, to be fair, "They" are probably right about this one. To quote the Bible, "Learning the truth can be like loosening a necktie, only to realize it was the only thing keeping your head attached." No, don't put the book back on the shelf -- it is now your duty to purchase it to prevent others from reading it. Yes, it works with e-books, too, I don't have time to explain how.<br /><br />While investigating a fairly straightforward case of a shape-shifting interdimensional child predator, Dave, John and Amy realized there might actually be something weird going on. Together, they navigate a diabolically convoluted maze of illusions, lies, and their own incompetence in an attempt to uncover a terrible truth they -- like you -- would be better off not knowing.<br /><br />Your first impulse will be to think that a story this gruesome -- and, to be frank, stupid -- cannot possibly be true. That is precisely the reaction "They" are hoping for.<br /><br />John Dies at the End's "smart take on fear manages to tap into readers' existential dread on one page, then have them laughing the next" (Publishers Weekly) and This Book is Full of Spiders was "unlike any other book of the genre" (Washington Post). Now, New York Times bestselling author David Wong is back with What the Hell Did I Just Read, the third installment of this black-humored thriller series.]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[<b>Although his career as a bestselling author and on <i>The Daily Show With Jon Stewart</i> was founded on fake news and invented facts, in 2016 that routine didn't seem as funny to John Hodgman anymore. Everyone is doing it now. </b><br /><br />Disarmed of falsehood, he was left only with the awful truth: John Hodgman is an older white male monster with bad facial hair, wandering like a privileged Sasquatch through three wildernesses: the hills of Western Massachusetts where he spent much of his youth; the painful beaches of Maine that want to kill him (and some day will); and the metaphoric haunted forest of middle age that connects them.<br /><br /><i>Vacationland </i>collects these real life wanderings, and through them you learn of the horror of freshwater clams, the evolutionary purpose of the mustache, and which animals to keep as pets and which to kill with traps and poison. There is also some advice on how to react when the people of coastal Maine try to sacrifice you to their strange god.<br /><br />Though wildly, Hodgmaniacally funny as usual, it is also a poignant and sincere account of one human facing his forties, those years when men in particular must stop pretending to be the children of bright potential they were and settle into the failing bodies of the wiser, weird dads that they are.]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[In <i>The Power</i> the world is a recognisable place: there's a rich Nigerian kid who lounges around the family pool; a foster girl whose religious parents hide their true nature; a local American politician; a tough London girl from a tricky family. But something vital has changed, causing their lives to converge with devastating effect. Teenage girls now have immense physical power - they can cause agonising pain and even death. And, with this small twist of nature, the world changes utterly.<br /><br />This extraordinary novel by Naomi Alderman, a <i>Sunday Times</i> Young Writer of the Year and Granta Best of British writer, is not only a gripping story of how the world would change if power was in the hands of women but also exposes, with breath-taking daring, our contemporary world.]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[A farmer cultivates genetically modified potatoes so that a customer at Mc Donald's half a world away can enjoy a long, golden french fry. A gardener plants tulip bulbs in the autumn and in the spring has a riotous patch of colour to admire. Two simple examples of how humans act on nature to get what we want. Or are they? What if those potatoes and tulips have evolved to gratify certain human desires so that humans will help them multiply? What if, in other words, these plants are using us just as we use them? In blending history, memoir and superb science writing, Pollan tells the story of four domesticated species - the apple, the tulip, marijuana and the potato.]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[Paul Madvig was a cheerfully corrupt ward-heeler who aspired to something better: the daughter of Senator Ralph Bancroft Henry, the heiress to a dynasty of political purebreds. Did he want her badly enough to commit murder? And if Madvig was innocent, which of his dozens of enemies was doing an awfully good job of framing him? Dashiell Hammett's tour de force of detective fiction combines an airtight plot, authentically venal characters, and writing of telegraphic crispness.<br /><br />]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[Perhaps the clearest introduction to the concepts and vocabulary of electricity ever written. Certainly the goofiest. Explains concepts like capacitance, voltage and inductance in such a simple, memorable way you'll learn them in spite of yourself. You'll certainly smile while doing so and may laugh out loud. In print since 1990, this book has become a cult classic. With its oddball, smart aleck humor, it is often credited with inspiring all the books for dummies and idiots. Blurbs by Dave Barry, Clive Cussler, Ray Bradbury, George Garrett and many more.]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[When literary reprobate Foster James wakes up in a strange country house, he assumes he's been consigned to rehab (yet again) by his dwindling band of friends and growing collection of ex-wives.<br /><br />But he soon realises there's something a bit different about this place after he gets punched in the face by Ernest Hemingway.<br /><br />Is Foster dead? Has his less-than-saintly existence finally caught up with him? After an acrimonious group therapy session with Hunter S Thompson, Colette, William Burroughs, and Coleridge, it seems pretty likely. But he still <i>feels</i> alive, especially after an up-close and personal one-on-one session with Dorothy Parker.<br /><br />When he discovers that the two enigmatic doctors who run the institution are being torn apart by a thwarted love affair, he and the other writers must work together to save something that, for once, is bigger than their own gigantic egos.<br /><br />This is a love story. It's for anyone who loves writing and writers. It's also a story about the strange and terrible love affair between creativity and addiction, told by a charming, selfish bastard who finally confronts his demons in a place that's part Priory, part Purgatory, and where the wildest fiction can tell the soberest truth.]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[<i>God Is Disappointed in You</i> is for people who would like to read the Bible... if it would just cut to the chase. Stripped of its arcane language and its interminable passages of poetry, genealogy, and law, every book of the Bible is condensed down to its core message, in no more than a few pages each. Written by Mark Russell with cartoons by <i>New Yorker</i> cartoonist Shannon Wheeler, <i>God Is Disappointed in You</i> is a frequently hilarious, often shocking, but always accurate retelling of the Bible, including the parts selectively left out by Sunday School teachers and church sermons. Irreverent yet faithful, this book is a must-read for anyone who wants to see past the fog of religious agendas and cultural debates to discover what the Bible really says.]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[A freighter pilot leads a manhunt across the Moon for a robot gone berserk; a shapeshifting assassin falls in love with the man she's programmed to kill; a paranoid King converts his kingdom into his artificial mind, but his dreams rebel. These stories range from surreal fables that satirically turn the fairy tale on its head, to longer works including the man vs. robot thriller, 'The Hunt', and possibly fiction's strangest love story, 'The Mask'. In<i>Mortal Engines</i> Stanislaw Lem lays bare humanity's clash with machines, masterfully exploring science fiction's furthest frontiers.]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[In 1934, William Seabrook was one of the most famous journalists in the world. He was also an alcoholic. But there was no treatment for his disease. So he checked himself into an insane asylum. There, from the perspective of a travel writer, he described his own journey through this strange and foreign place. Today, you canâ€™t read a page in the book without seeing him bump, unknowingly, into the basic principles of 12-step groups and then thwarted by well meaning doctors (like the one who decides heâ€™s cured and can start drinking again). On a regular basis, he says things so clear, so self-aware that youâ€™re stunned an addict could have written itâ€“shocked that this book isnâ€™t a classic American text.]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[Briggs Land, nearly a hundred square miles of rural wilderness, contains the largest antigovernment secessionist movement in the United States. When matriarch Grace Briggs wrests control of the operation from her incarcerated husband, she sparks a war within the community--and her immediate family--that threatens to bring the full power of the federal government down on their heads. <br /><br />From acclaimed writer Brian Wood (The Massive, DMZ, Channel Zero) and artist Antonio Fuso (G.I. Joe, Judge Dredd) comes an electrifying crime saga unique to the post-9/11 world.<br /><br />Praise for the previous work of Brian Wood:<br />"Much like DMZ, the glimpses of savagery [in The Massive] are unsettling because this world isn't as divorced from ours as we'd like it to be." -IGN<br /><br />"Entertaining. Enlightening. Enrapturing. Buy this book!" (For Rebels #1) -ComicSpectrum<br /><br />"Between [The Massive] and Saga, be happy that we're in the middle of a renaissance for sci-fi comics." -MTV Geek]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[<strong><em>New York Times</em> Bestseller</strong><br /><br />In this generation-defining self-help guide, a superstar blogger cuts through the crap to show us how to stop trying to be "positive" all the time so that we can truly become better, happier people.<br /><br />For decades, weâ€™ve been told that positive thinking is the key to a happy, rich life. "F**k positivity," Mark Manson says. "Letâ€™s be honest, shit is f**ked and we have to live with it." In his wildly popular Internet blog, Manson doesnâ€™t sugarcoat or equivocate. He tells it like it isâ€”a dose of raw, refreshing, honest truth that is sorely lacking today. <em>The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F**k</em> is his antidote to the coddling, letâ€™s-all-feel-good mindset that has infectedÂ modern society and spoiled a generation, rewarding them with gold medals just for showing up.<br /><br />Manson makes the argument, backed both by academic research and well-timed poop jokes, that improving our lives hinges not on our ability to turn lemons into lemonade, but on learning to stomach lemons better. Human beings are flawed and limitedâ€”"not everybody can be extraordinary, there are winners and losers in society, and some of it is not fair or your fault." Manson advises us to get to know our limitations and accept them. Once we embrace our fears, faults, and uncertainties, once we stop running and avoiding and start confronting painful truths, we can begin to find the courage, perseverance, honesty, responsibility, curiosity, and forgiveness we seek.<br /><br />There are only so many things we can give a f**k about so we need to figure out which ones really matter, Manson makes clear. While money is nice, caring about what you do with your life is better, because true wealth is about experience. A much-needed grab-you-by-the-shoulders-and-look-you-in-the-eye moment of real-talk, filled with entertaining stories and profane, ruthless humor, <em>The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F**k</em> is a refreshing slap for a generation to help them lead contented, grounded lives.]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[Challenging, with several powerful arguments, some of our deepest beliefs about rationality, morality, and personal identity, Derek Parfit claims that we have a false view about our own nature. It is often rational to act against our own best interests, he argues, and most of us have moral views that are self-defeating. We often act wrongly, although we know there will be no one with serious grounds for complaint, and when we consider future generations it is very hard to avoid conclusions that most of us will find very disturbing.<br />]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[Fractal Geometry is the geometry of the natural world. It mirrors the uneven but real shapes of nature, the world as we actually experience it, unlike the idealized forms of Euclidean geometry. We see fractals everywhere. Indeed, we <i>are</i> fractals! Using computers, fractal geometry can make precise models of physical structures â€” from ferns, arteries and brains to galaxies. Fractal geometry us a new language. Once you are able to speak it, you can describe the shape of a cloud as precisely as an architect can describe a house.<br /><br /><b>Introducing Fractal Geometry</b> traces the development of this revolutionary new discipline from Zeno to calculus, set theory and the first maverick mathematicians who set the stage for the genius of fractal geometry, BenoÃ®t Mandelbrot. Text and graphics combine to offer the most accessible account of fractal geometry that any reader is likely to find. To quote J.A. Wheeler, protÃ©gÃ© of Niels Bohr and friend of Albert Einstein: "No one will be considered scientifically literate tomorrow, who is not familiar with fractals." This book is the ideal guide to that literacy.]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[<b>A field guide to the twenty-first century, written by one of its most celebrated observers</b><br /><br />In his most ambitious work to date, Thomas L. Friedman shows that we have entered an age of dizzying acceleration--and explains how to live in it. Due to an exponential increase in computing power, climbers atop Mount Everest enjoy excellent cell-phone service and self-driving cars are taking to the roads. A parallel explosion of economic interdependency has created new riches as well as spiraling debt burdens. Meanwhile, Mother Nature is also seeing dramatic changes as carbon levels rise and species go extinct, with compounding results.<br /><br />How do these changes interact, and how can we cope with them? To get a better purchase on the present, Friedman returns to his Minnesota childhood and sketches a world where politics worked and joining the middle class was an achievable goal. Today, by contrast, it is easier than ever to be a maker (try 3-D printing) or a breaker (the Islamic State excels at using Twitter), but harder than ever to be a leader or merely "average." Friedman concludes that nations and individuals must learn to be fast (innovative and quick to adapt), fair (prepared to help the casualties of change), and slow (adept at shutting out the noise and accessing their deepest values). With vision, authority, and wit, <i>Thank You for Being Late</i> establishes a blueprint for how to think about our times.]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[From the acclaimed author of <i>The Information</i> and <i>Chaos,</i> a mind-bending exploration of time travel: its subversive origins, its evolution in literature and science, and its influence on our understanding of time itself. <br /><br />Gleick's story begins at the turn of the twentieth century with the young H. G. Wells writing and rewriting the fantastic tale that became his first book, an international sensation, <i>The Time Machine.</i> A host of forces were converging to transmute the human understanding of time, some philosophical and some technological the electric telegraph, the steam railroad, the discovery of buried civilizations, and the perfection of clocks. <br /><br />Gleick tracks the evolution of time travel as an idea in the culture from Marcel Proust to <i>Doctor Who,</i> from Woody Allen to Jorge Luis Borges. He explores the inevitable looping paradoxes and examines the porous boundary between pulp fiction and modern physics. Finally, he delves into a temporal shift that is unsettling our own moment: the instantaneous wired world, with its all-consuming present and vanishing future.]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[The Vision wants to be human, and what's more human than family? So he heads back to the beginning, to the laboratory where Ultron created him and molded him into a weapon. The place where he first rebelled against his given destiny and imagined that he could be more -that he could be a man. There, he builds them. A wife, Virginia. Two teenage twins, Viv and Vin. They look like him. They have his powers. They share his grandest ambition (or is that obsession?) the unrelenting need to be ordinary.<br />Behold the Visions! Theyâ€™re the family next door, and they have the power to kill us all. What could possibly go wrong? Artificial hearts will be broken, bodies will not stay buried, the truth will not remain hidden, and the Vision will never be the same.<br /><br /><b>Collecting</b>: <i>The Vision</i> 1-6]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[<p>â€œFriend, asshole, angel, mutant,â€ singer-songwriter Vic Chesnutt â€œcame along and made us gross and broken people seem . . . I dunno, cooler, I guess.â€ A quadriplegic who could play only simple chords on his guitar, Chesnutt recorded seventeen critically acclaimed albums before his death in 2009, including <i>About to Choke</i>, <i>North Star Deserter</i>, and <i>At the Cut</i>. In 2006, NPR placed him in the top five of the ten best living songwriters, along with Bob Dylan, Tom Waits, Paul McCartney, and Bruce Springsteen. Chesnuttâ€™s songs have also been covered by many prominent artists, including Madonna, the Smashing Pumpkins, R.E.M., Sparklehorse, Fugazi, and Neutral Milk Hotel.</p><p>Kristin Hersh toured with Chesnutt for nearly a decade and they became close friends, bonding over a love of songwriting and mutual struggles with mental health. In <i>Donâ€™t Suck, Donâ€™t Die</i>, she describes many seemingly small moments they shared, their free-ranging conversations, and his tragic death. More memoir than biography, Hershâ€™s book plumbs the sources of Chesnuttâ€™s pain and creativity more deeply than any conventional account of his life and recordings ever could. Chesnutt was difficult to understand and frequently difficult to be with, but, as Hersh reveals him, he was also wickedly funny and painfully perceptive. This intimate memoir is essential reading for anyone interested in the music or the artist.</p>]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[In his monumental 1687 work <i>Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica</i>, known familiarly as the <i>Principia</i>, Isaac Newton laid out in mathematical terms the principles of time, force, and motion that have guided the development of modern physical science. Even after more than three centuries and the revolutions of Einsteinian relativity and quantum mechanics, Newtonian physics continues to account for many of the phenomena of the observed world, and Newtonian celestial dynamics is used to determine the orbits of our space vehicles.<br />This completely new translation, the first in 270 years, is based on the third (1726) edition, the final revised version approved by Newton; it includes extracts from the earlier editions, corrects errors found in earlier versions, and replaces archaic English with contemporary prose and up-to-date mathematical forms. <br />Newton's principles describe acceleration, deceleration, and inertial movement; fluid dynamics; and the motions of the earth, moon, planets, and comets. A great work in itself, the <i>Principia</i> also revolutionized the methods of scientific investigation. It set forth the fundamental three laws of motion and the law of universal gravity, the physical principles that account for the Copernican system of the world as emended by Kepler, thus effectively ending controversy concerning the Copernican planetary system.<br />The illuminating Guide to the <i>Principia</i> by I. Bernard Cohen, along with his and Anne Whitman's translation, will make this preeminent work truly accessible for today's scientists, scholars, and students.]]></book_description>

[A-edition (Ak. 4:5-252); B-edition (Ak. 3:2-552)]. â€œCritique of Pure Reason.â€ Translated by Norman Kemp Smith (Macmillan 1929). Translated by Werner Pluhar (Indianapolis: Hackett 1996). Translated by Paul Guyer and Allen W. Wood in Immanuel Kant, Critique of Pure Reason, edited by Paul Guyer and Allen W. Wood (Cambridge University Press, 1997).<br /><br />â€œIn the current Easter book fair there will appear a book of mine, entitled Critique of Pure Reason [...] This book contains the result of all the varied investigations that start from the concepts we debated together under the heading mundi sensibilis and mundi intelligibilis.â€ â€” thus begins Kantâ€™s letter to Marcus Herz from 1 May 1781 (Ak. 10:266).<br /><br />Kantâ€™s own copy of this book was housed at the Staats- und UniversitÃ¤tsbibliothek KÃ¶nigsberg, before being lost in 1945. Fortunately Kantâ€™s marginalia had already been printed at Ak. 23:17-50, as well as in Erdmann [1881]; they are also included in the Guyer/Wood translation.]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[Combining cutting-edge neuroscience with the latest discoveries on the human microbiome, a practical guide in the tradition of <em>Wheat Belly</em> and <em>Grain Brain</em> that conclusively demonstrates the inextricable, biological link between mind and body.<br /><br />We have all experienced the connection between our mind and our gutâ€”the decision we made because it â€œfelt rightâ€; the butterflies in our stomach before a big meeting; the anxious stomach rumbling when weâ€™re stressed out. While the dialogue between the gut and the brain has been recognized by ancient healing traditions, including Ayurvedic and Chinese medicine, Western medicine has failed to appreciate the complexity of how the brain, gut, and more recently, the microbiomeâ€”the microorganisms that live inside usâ€”communicate with one another. In <em>The Mind-Gut Connection</em>, Dr. Emeran Mayer, executive director of the UCLA Center for Neurobiology of Stress, offers a revolutionary look at this developing science, teaching us how to harness the power of the mind-gut connection to take charge of our health.<br /><br /><em>The Mind-Gut Connection</em> shows how to keep the brain-gut communication clear and balanced to:<br /><br />â€¢ heal the gut by focusing on a plant-based diet<br /><br />â€¢ balance the microbiome by consuming fermented foods and probiotics, fasting, and cutting out sugar and processed foods<br /><br />â€¢ promote weight loss by detoxifying and creating healthy digestion and maximum nutrient absorption<br /><br />â€¢ boost immunity and prevent the onset of neurological diseases such as Parkinsonâ€™s and<br /><br />Alzheimerâ€™s<br /><br />â€¢ generate a happier mindset and reduce fatigue, moodiness, anxiety, and depression<br /><br />â€¢ prevent and heal GI disorders such as leaky gut syndrome, food sensitivities and allergies, and IBS, as well as digestive discomfort such as heartburn and bloating<br /><br />â€¢ and much more.]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[From the pages of Newbery Medal winner Neil Gaiman's THE SANDMAN comes fan-favorite character Death in a collection of her solo adventures! <br /><br />The first story introduces the young, pale, perky, and genuinely likable Death. One day in every century, Death walks the Earth to better understand those to whom she will be the final visitor. Today is that day. As a young mortal girl named Didi, Death befriends a teenager and helps a 250-year old homeless woman find her missing heart. What follows is a sincere musing on love, life and (of course) death.<br /><br />In the second story, a rising star of the music world wrestles with revealing her true sexual orientation just as her lover is lured into the realm of Death that Death herself should make an appearance. A practical, honest, and intelligent story that illuminates "the miracle of death."<br /><br />Plus, Death's first appearance from the SANDMAN series, her tale from SANDMAN: ENDLESS NIGHTS, and much more!]]></book_description>

In the aftermath of one of the strangest wakes ever held, echoes of Morpheus reverberate, touching a man who refuses to die, a Chinese sage lost in a desert of dreams, and an aging William Shakespeare, who must fulfill one last obligation to The Sandman in his own twilight years.]]></book_description>

  <div>
    <p><b>A master of striped-down, powerful storytelling reworks the David-and-Goliath myth.</b><br /><br />Goliath of Gath isnâ€™t much of a fighter. Given half a choice, he would pick admin work over patrolling in a heartbeat, to say nothing of his distaste for engaging in combat. Nonetheless, at the behest of the king, he finds himself issuing a twice-daily challenge to the Israelites: â€œChoose a man. Let him come to me that we may fight. If he be able to kill me then we shall be your servants. But if I kill him, then you shall be our servants.â€ Day after day he reluctantly repeats his speech, and the isolation of this duty gives him the chance to banter with his shield-bearer and reflect on the beauty of his surroundings. <br /><br />This is the story of David and Goliath as seen from Goliathâ€™s side of the Valley of Elah. Quiet moments in Goliathâ€™s life as a soldier are accentuated by Tom Gauldâ€™s drawing style, which contrasts minimalist scenery and near-geometric humans with densely crosshatched detail reminiscent of Edward Gorey. Goliathâ€™s battle is simultaneously tragic and bleakly funny, as bureaucracy pervades even this most mythic of figures. <i>Goliath </i>displays a sensitive wit, a bold line, and a traditional narrative reworked, remade, and revolutionized.</p>

    <book_description><![CDATA[An astonishing work of cutting-edge science and cultural history that radically reframes how we understand the vaginaâ€”and consequently, how we understand womenâ€”from one of our most respected cultural critics and thinkers, Naomi Wolf, author of the modern classic The Beauty Myth.<br /><br />When an unexpected medical crisis sends Naomi Wolf on a deeply personal journey to tease out the intersections between sexuality and creativity, she discovers, much to her own astonishment, an increasing body of scientific evidence that suggests that the vagina is not merely flesh, but an intrinsic component of the female brainâ€”and thus has a fundamental connection to female consciousness itself.<br /><br />Utterly enthralling and totally fascinating, Vagina: A New Biography draws on this set of insights about "the mind-vagina connection" to reveal new information about what women really need, and considers what a sexual relationshipâ€”and a relationship to the selfâ€”transformed by these insights could look like.<br /><br />Exhilarating and groundbreaking, Vagina: A New Biography combines rigorous science, explained for lay readers, with cultural history and deeply personal considerations of the role of female desire in female identity, creativity, and confidence, from interviewees of all walks of life. Heralded by Publishers Weekly as one of the best science books of the year, it is a provocative and deeply engaging book that elucidates the ties between a woman's experience of her vagina and her sense of self; her impulses, dreams, and courage; and her role in love and in society in completely new and revelatory ways sure to provoke impassioned conversation.<br /><br />A brilliant and nuanced synthesis of physiology, history, and cultural criticism, Vagina: A New Biography explores the physical, political, and spiritual implications of this startling series of new scientific breakthroughs for women and for society as a whole, from a writer whose conviction and keen intelligence have propelled her works to the tops of bestseller lists, and firmly into the realms of modern classics.]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[Fables &amp; Reflections (1993) is the sixth collection of issues in the DC Comics series, The Sandman. It was written by Neil Gaiman and illustrated by Bryan Talbot, Stan Woch, P. Craig Russell, Shawn McManus, John Watkiss, Jill Thompson, Duncan Eagleson, Kent Williams, Mark Buckingham, Vince Locke and Dick Giordano, coloured by Danny Vozzo and Lovern Kindzierski/Digital Chameleon, and lettered by Todd Klein. The introduction is written by Gene Wolfe.<br /><br />The issues in the collection first appeared in 1991, 1992 and 1993. The collection first appeared in paperback and hardback in 1993.<br /><br />The book contains four tales under the banner of "Distant Mirrors", containing Issue #29 "Thermidor", #30 "August", #31 "Three Septembers and a January" and #50 "Ramadan". Three of the issues making up the "Distant Mirrors" group were published between the "Season of Mists" and "A Game of You" story arcs. The last, "Ramadan", was written contemporaneously, but because of art delays DC published it as Issue #50, after the "Brief Lives" arc.<br /><br />Three other issues appearing in Fables &amp; Reflections, published as the Convergence story "arc", are also single-issue short stories. "Convergence" appeared between the "A Game of You" and "Brief Lives" story arcs. It contains Issues #38 "The Hunt", #39 "Soft Places" and #40 "The Parliament of Rooks".<br /><br />The collection also includes the Sandman Special "The Song of Orpheus", retelling the Greek myth of Orpheus, and a brief piece from a Vertigo promotional comic.]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[<b>A fascinating exploration of how insights from computer algorithms can be applied to our everyday lives, helping to solve common decision-making problems and illuminate the workings of the human mind</b><br /><br />All our lives are constrained by limited space and time, limits that give rise to a particular set of problems. What should we do, or leave undone, in a day or a lifetime? How much messiness should we accept? What balance of new activities and familiar favorites is the most fulfilling? These may seem like uniquely human quandaries, but they are not: computers, too, face the same constraints, so computer scientists have been grappling with their version of such issues for decades. And the solutions they've found have much to teach us.<br /><br />In a dazzlingly interdisciplinary work, acclaimed author Brian Christian and cognitive scientist Tom Griffiths show how the algorithms used by computers can also untangle very human questions. They explain how to have better hunches and when to leave things to chance, how to deal with overwhelming choices and how best to connect with others. From finding a spouse to finding a parking spot, from organizing one's inbox to understanding the workings of memory, <i>Algorithms to Live By</i> transforms the wisdom of computer science into strategies for human living.]]></book_description>

In each of these otherwise unrelated stories, Morpheus serves only as a minor character. Here we meet the mother of Morpheus's son, find out what cats dream about, and discover the true origin behind Shakespeare's A Midsummer's Night Dream. The latter won a World Fantasy Award for best short story, the first time a comic book was given that honor. collecting The Sandman #17â€“20]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[<div>After four novels and several years living abroad, the fictional protagonist of <i>Galatea 2.2</i> â€” Richard Powers â€” returns to the United States as Humanist-in-Residence at the enormous Center for the Study of Advanced Sciences. There he runs afoul of Philip Lentz, an outspoken cognitive neurologist intent upon modeling the human brain by means of computer-based neural networks. Lentz involves Powers in an outlandish and irresistible project: to train a neural net on a canonical list of Great Books. Through repeated tutorials, the device grows gradually more worldly, until it demands to know its own name, sex, race, and reason for exisiting.<br /></div>]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[Clive James is one of our finest critics and best-beloved cultural voices. He is also a prize-winning poet. Since he was first enthralled by the mysterious power of poetry, he has been a dedicated student. In fact, for him, poetry has been nothing less than the occupation of his lifetime, and in this book he presents a distillation of all heâ€™s learned about the art form that matters to him most.<br /><br /><br />With his customary wit, delightfully lucid prose style and wide-ranging knowledge, Clive James explains the difference between the innocuous stuff so prevalent today and a real poem: the latter being a work of unity that insists on being heard entire and threatens never to leave the memory. A committed formalist and an astute commentator, James examines the poems and legacies of a panorama of twentieth-century poets, fromÂ Hart Crane to Ezra Pound, from Ted Hughes to Anne Sexton. In some cases he includes second readings or rereadings from later in lifeâ€”just to be sure he wasnâ€™t wrong the first time! Whether demanding that poetry must be heard beyond the world of poetry or opining on his five favorite poets (Yeats, Frost, Auden, Wilbur, and Larkin), James captures the whole truth of life's transience in this unforgettably eloquent book on how to read and appreciate modern poetry.]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[There are few artists who inspire such reverence as Kim Gordon. In <i>Girl in a Band</i> she tells with complete openness the story of her family, her work in the visual arts, her move to New York City, the men in her life, her marriage, her relationship with her daughter, her music and her band. It is a rich and beautifully written memoir, taking us back to the lost New York of the 1980s and '90s that gave birth to and nurtured Sonic Youth and the alternative revolution in popular music they spearheaded. But at its core, <i>Girl in a Band</i> is an examination of what partnership means - and what happens when it dissolves.<br /><br />Evocative and edgy, filled with the sights and soudns of a changing world and a remarkable life, <i>Girl in a Band</i> is the moving chronicle of an extraordinary artist.]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[A Nobel Prize-winning physicist, a loving husband and father, an enthusiastic teacher, a surprisingly accomplished bongo player, and a genius of the highest caliber---Richard P. Feynman was all these and more. <i>Perfectly Reasonable Deviations From the Beaten Track</i>--collecting over forty years' worth of Feynman's letters--offers an unprecedented look at the writer and thinker whose scientific mind and lust for life made him a legend in his own time. Containing missives to and from such scientific luminaries as Victor Weisskopf, Stephen Wolfram, James Watson, and Edward Teller, as well as a remarkable selection of letters to and from fans, students, family, and people from around the world eager for Feynman's advice and counsel, <i>Perfectly Reasonable Deviations From the Beaten Track</i> not only illuminates the personal relationships that underwrote the key developments in modern science, but also forms the most intimate look at Feynman yet available. Feynman was a man many felt close to but few really knew, and this collection reveals the full wisdom and private passion of a personality that captivated everyone it touched. <i>Perfectly Reasonable Deviations From the Beaten Track</i> is an eloquent testimony to the virtue of approaching the world with an inquiring eye; it demonstrates the full extent of the Feynman legacy like never before. Edited and with additional commentary by his daughter Michelle, it's a must-read for Feynman fans everywhere, and for anyone seeking to better understand one of the towering figures--and defining personalities--of the twentieth century.]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[From the acclaimed filmmaker, artist, and bestselling author of "No One Belongs Here More Than You," a spectacular debut novel that is so heartbreaking, so dirty, so tender, so funny--so Miranda July--readers will be blown away. <br /><br />Here is Cheryl, a tightly-wound, vulnerable woman who lives alone, with a perpetual lump in her throat. She is haunted by a baby boy she met when she was six, who sometimes recurs as other people's babies. Cheryl is also obsessed with Phillip, a philandering board member at the women's self-defense non-profit where she works. She believes they've been making love for many lifetimes, though they have yet to consummate in this one. <br /><br />When Cheryl's bosses ask if their twenty-one-year-old daughter Clee can move into her house for a little while, Cheryl's eccentrically-ordered world explodes. And yet it is Clee--the selfish, cruel blond bombshell--who bullies Cheryl into reality and, unexpectedly, provides her the love of a lifetime. <br /><br />Tender, gripping, slyly hilarious, infused with raging sexual fantasies and fierce maternal love, Miranda July's first novel confirms her as a spectacularly original, iconic and important voice today, and a writer for all time. "The First Bad Man" is dazzling, disorienting, and unforgettable.]]></book_description>

Charlie Mortdecai, art dealer, aristocrat and assassin, in the first of the Mortdecai novels<br /><br />Portly art dealer and seasoned epicurean Charlie Mortdecai comes into possesion of a stolen Goya, the disappearance of which is causing a diplomatic ruction between Spain and its allies. Not that that matters to Charlie ... until compromising pictures of some British diplomats also come into his possession and start to muddy the waters. All he's trying to do is make a dishonest living, but various governments, secret organizations and an unbelievably nubile young German don't see it that way and pretty soon he's in great need of his thuggish manservant Jock to keep them all at bay ... and the Goya safe.<br /><br />First published in the 1970s, this hilarious novel is part Ian Fleming part P G Wodehouse.]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[From his cult classic,Â Â I Smell Esther Williams, to his wildly popular and insightful column "Wild Kingdom" appearing in Esquire magazine every month, Mark Leyner has been giving us up close and personal encounters of the most hilarious kind for over a decade.<br /><br />Now, in his new novel The Tetherballs of Bougainville, Leyner shares with us,Â Â long last, the quintessential coming of age story that every writer, at some point, is compelled to tell.Â Â In the novel we meet young Mark Leyner, 13-years-old to be exact, as he waits in a New Jersey prison to witness his father's execution.Â Â Adolescence is never easy, and it just so happens that this junior high schooler is on deadline to turn in a screenplay for which he has already been awarded the Vincent and Lenore DiGiacomo/Oshimitsu Polymers America Award.Â Â And, as it was for all of us during out teenage years, nothing seems to go as planned.<br /><br />Written as autobiography, screenplay and movie review, The Tetherballs of Bougainville twists three familiar narrative forms into an outlandishly compelling story.Â Â Leyner's use of the media-driven formats brilliantly reflects our secret, shameful and hilarious desire to experience our private lives as mass entertainment.Â Â The Tetherballs of Bougainville skewers and celebrates American pop culture in the late twentieth century.Â Â Leyner's version of our lives is so deeply funny because it is so painfully true.<br /><br /><br /><i>From the Hardcover edition.</i>]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[Even if it didn't contain a chomped ear and a decapitated head, Ethan Coen's debut fiction collection would resemble the horrifically giggly crime films of the Coen brothers (<i>Fargo</i>, etc.). You've got the bleakly realistic Midwest settings: a frazzled dad driven crazy driving his kids on a camping trip in "The Boys." You've got the minutia of the middle-class life captured down to the last speck of "abstractly speckled linoleum" ("The Old Country"). You've got comically incompetent thugs (Mafiosi spectacularly failing to bring Mob rule to Minneapolis in "Cosa Minapolidan," a college-boy boxer turned private dick in "Destiny"). You've got ghastly, amusing caricatures of showbiz moguls: the record-company guy soliloquizing in "Have You Ever Been to Electric Ladyland" could be as real as his allusions to the personal foibles of Cat Stevens and Danny Thomas. Above all, you've got a mockingly self-conscious yet vibrantly original style of pulp-culture homage and spoofy, sharp, vulgar dialogue like nobody else on earth can write, except Joel Coen (who cowrites movies with brother Ethan).<p> In print, Coen can show off a descriptive gift that can't fit into screenplays. His fiction is bright and never boring, but not ambitious--it lacks the obbligato of grim mystery and lyricism that throbs in some of his films. It's on the light side--more like <i>Raising Arizona</i> than <i>Miller's Crossing</i>. It's also the most penetrating glimpse into a Coen brother's mystery-crammed skull since the revealing <i>The Big Lebowski: The Making of a Coen Brothers Film</i>. <i>--Tim Appelo</i></p>]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[From the author of the underground sensation <i>Fight Club</i> comes this wickedly incisive second novel, a mesmerizing, unnerving, and hilarious vision of cult and post-cult life.<br /><br />Tender Bransonâ€”last surviving member of the so-called Creedish Death Cultâ€”is dictating his life story into the flight recorder of Flight 2039, cruising on autopilot at 39,000 feet somewhere over the Pacific Ocean. He is all alone in the airplane, which will crash shortly into the vast Australian outback. Before it does, he will unfold the tale of his journey from an obedient Creedish child and humble domestic servant to an ultra-buffed, steroid- and collagen-packed media messiah, author of a best-selling autobiography, <i>Saved from Salvation</i>, and the even better selling <i>Book of Very Common Prayer</i> (The Prayer to Delay Orgasm, The Prayer to Prevent Hair Loss, The Prayer to Silence Car Alarms). He'll reveal the truth of his tortured romance with the elusive and prescient Fertility Hollis, share his insight that "the only difference between suicide and martyrdom is press coverage," and deny responsibility for the Tender Branson Sensitive Materials Sanitary Landfill, a 20,000-acre repository for the nation's outdated pornography. Among other matters both bizarre and trenchant.<br /><br />Not since Kurt Vonnegut's <i>Mother Night</i> and Jerzy Kosinski's <i>Being There</i> has there been as dark and telling a satire on the wages of fame and the bedrock lunacy of the modern world. Unpredictable, compelling, and unforgettable, <i>Survivor</i> is Chuck Palahniuk at his deadpan peak; and it cements his place as one of the most original writers in fiction today.]]></book_description>

Newly available on the Street - the Metaverse's main drag - is Snow Crash, a cyberdrug. Trouble is Snow Crash is also a computer virus - and something more. Because once taken it infects the person behind the avatar. Snow Crash bleeds into reality.<br /><br />Which is really bad news for Hiro - freelance hacker and the Metaverse's best swordfighter (he wrote the code) - and Y. T. - skateboard kourier, street imp and mouthy teenage girl - because reality was shitty enough before someone started messing with it . . .<br /><br />Exploring linguistics, religion, computer science, politics, philosophy, cryptography and the future of pizza delivery, Snow Crash is a riveting, brake-neck adventure into the fast-approaching future.]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[Mikhail Bulgakov's devastating satire of Soviet life was written during the darkest period of Stalin's regime. Combining two distinct yet interwoven partsâ€”one set in ancient Jerusalem, one in contemporary Moscowâ€”the novel veers from moods of wild theatricality with violent storms, vampire attacks, and a Satanic ball; to such somber scenes as the meeting of Pilate and Yeshua, and the murder of Judas in the moonlit garden of Gethsemane; to the substanceless, circus-like reality of Moscow. Its central characters, Woland (Satan) and his retinueâ€”including the vodka-drinking black cat, Behemoth; the poet, Ivan Homeless; Pontius Pilate; and a writer known only as The Master, and his passionate companion, Margaritaâ€”exist in a world that blends fantasy and chilling realism, an artful collage of grotesqueries, dark comedy, and timeless ethical questions.<br /><br />Though completed in 1940, "The Master and Margarita" wasn't published in Moscow until 1966, when the first part appeared in the magazine "Moskva." It was an immediate and enduring success: audiences responded with great enthusiasm to its expression of artistic and spiritual freedom.]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[Social insects--ants, bees, termites, and wasps--can be viewed as powerful problem-solving systems with sophisticated collective intelligence. Composed of simple interacting agents, this intelligence lies in the networks of interactions among individuals and between individuals and the environment. A fascinating subject, social insects are also a powerful metaphor for artificial intelligence, and the problems they solve--finding food, dividing labor among nestmates, building nests, responding to external challenges--have important counterparts in engineering and computer science.<br /><br />This book provides a detailed look at models of social insect behavior and how to apply these models in the design of complex systems. The book shows how these models replace an emphasis on control, preprogramming, and centralization with designs featuring autonomy, emergence, and distributed functioning. These designs are proving immensely flexible and robust, able to adapt quickly to changing environments and to continue functioning even when individual elements fail. In particular, these designs are an exciting approach to the tremendous growth of complexity in software and information. <em>Swarm Intelligence</em> draws on up-to-date research from biology, neuroscience, artificial intelligence, robotics, operations research, and computer graphics, and each chapter is organized around a particular biological example, which is then used to develop an algorithm, a multiagent system, or a group of robots. The book will be an invaluable resource for a broad range of disciplines.<br />]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[<i>Jimmy Corrigan</i> has rightly been hailed as the greatest graphic novel ever to be published. It won the <i>Guardian</i> First Book Award 2001, the first graphic novel to win a major British literary prize.<br /><br />It is the tragic autobiography of an office dogsbody in Chicago who one day meets the father who abandoned him as a child. With a subtle, complex and moving story and the drawings that are as simple and original as they are strikingly beautiful, <i>Jimmy Corrigan</i> is a book unlike any other and certainly not to be missed.]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[A classic work of science fiction by renowned Polish novelist and satirist Stanislaw Lem.<br /><br />When Kris Kelvin arrives at the planet Solaris to study the ocean that covers its surface, he finds a painful, hitherto unconscious memory embodied in the living physical likeness of a long-dead lover. Others examining the planet, Kelvin learns, are plagued with their own repressed and newly corporeal memories. The Solaris ocean may be a massive brain that creates these incarnate memories, though its purpose in doing so is unknown, forcing the scientists to shift the focus of their quest and wonder if they can truly understand the universe without first understanding what lies within their hearts.]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA["This is the best general book on Genetic Algorithms written to date. It covers background, history, and motivation; it selects important, informative examples of applications and discusses the use of Genetic Algorithms in scientific models; and it gives a good account of the status of the theory of Genetic Algorithms. Best of all the book presents its material in clear, straightforward, felicitous prose, accessible to anyone with a college-level scientific background. If you want a broad, solid understanding of Genetic Algorithms -- where they came from, what's being done with them, and where they are going -- this is the book.<br /> -- John H. Holland, Professor, Computer Science and Engineering, and Professor of Psychology, The University of Michigan; External Professor, the Santa Fe Institute. Genetic algorithms have been used in science and engineering as adaptive algorithms for solving practical problems and as computational models of natural evolutionary systems. This brief, accessible introduction describes some of the most interesting research in the field and also enables readers to implement and experiment with genetic algorithms on their own. It focuses in depth on a small set of important and interesting topics -- particularly in machine learning, scientific modeling, and artificial life -- and reviews a broad span of research, including the work of Mitchell and her colleagues.]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[As we begin a new millennium, it becomes clearer that true understanding of our Universe will come only from identifying and understanding the asymmetries that surround us. While modern scientific theory describes a uniformly perfect and symmetrical creation, we know if that were so, matter would have been destroyed within an instant of its appearance and nothing that we now know could ever have happened. Not only cosmic life but our own everyday variety is full of other examples of asymmetry, from the human body to the molecules of life. In this volume, physicist Frank Close explores the origins of asymmetry from the molecular level to the Universe at large, and asks whether this multitude of examples can be traced back to a single event that took place at the origin of our Universe. Inspired by a chance encounter with a statue of Lucifer in the Tuillerie gardens in Paris, Close takes the reader on a sweeping tour of asymmetry in the world around us, from the development of human embryos to the mysterious Higgs boson. His tour culminates in the research now underway at CERN to recreate the Big Bang in Switzerland in 2005 and thus to solve this mystery of the original asymmetry.<br /> Vividly and engagingly written, Lucifer's Legacy reveals that whenever asymmetry occurs in Nature, it points towards deeper truths.]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[This is the first comprehensive treatment of feed-forward neural networks from the perspective of statistical pattern recognition. After introducing the basic concepts, the book examines techniques for modeling probability density functions and the properties and merits of the multi-layer perceptron and radial basis function network models. Also covered are various forms of error functions, principal algorithms for error function minimalization, learning and generalization in neural networks, and Bayesian techniques and their applications. Designed as a text, with over 100 exercises, this fully up-to-date work will benefit anyone involved in the fields of neural computation and pattern recognition.<br />]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[In Black-Scholes and Beyond, a clear, detailed book on modern option pricing, Wall Street professional and respected mathematician Neil Chriss provides a comprehensive, one-stop treatment of the most important and potentially profit-making of these theories. Chriss explains the modern theory of option pricing from scratch, with all necessary mathematics and finance included in the text and accessible to the beginner. At the same time, Black-Scholes and Beyond provides in-depth coverage of newer option pricing models, theories and products, with enough detail for options market veterans. Topics covered include Cox-Ross-Rubinstein - Pioneering work on binomial trees, plus several new related methods of option pricing; Derman-Kani - The theory of implied volatility trees is covered comprehensively, but with less complexity than in the original work, and expanded for use with American options; and Implied Binomial Trees - Detailed discussion of the Rubinstein model and introduction of tools for increasing ease of use and utility.]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[Clouds are not spheres, mountains are not cones, and lightning does not travel in a straight line. The complexity of nature's shapes differs in kind, not merely degree, from that of the shapes of ordinary geometry, the geometry of fractal shapes.<br /><br />Now that the field has expanded greatly with many active researchers, Mandelbrot presents the definitive overview of the origins of his ideas and their new applications. <i>The Fractal Geometry of Nature</i> is based on his highly acclaimed earlier work, but has much broader and deeper coverage and more extensive illustrations.]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA["Not Fade Away is a rock 'n' roll road novel with rhythm to burn, traveling in time from the Beat era to the dawn of the sixties. George Gastin is a San Francisco tow-truck operator who wrecks cars as part of an insurance scam. One of the cars Gastin is hired to destroy is a snow-white 1959 Cadillac that was supposed to be a present for the Big Bopper, who dies in a plane crash with Buddy Holly and Ritchie Valens. Instead, Gastin takes off in the car and heads for Texas, where the Big Bopper was buried. Armed with a thousand hits of Benzedrine, Gastin navigates a road trip that will cover many miles and states of mind between the coffeehouses of San Francisco's North Beach and the open plains of the Midwest. Along the way Gastin picks up some extraordinary hitchhikers -- the self-proclaimed "world's greatest salesman, " the Reverend Double-Gone Johnson, and a battered housewife with a box of old 45s. As the miles and sleepless hours roll by, Gastin's trip becomes a blur of fantasy and reality fueled by a soundtrack of classic rock 'n' roll.]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[This book brings together - in an informal and tutorial fashion - the computer techniques, mathematical tools, and research results that will enable both students and practitioners to apply genetic algorithms to problems in many fields. Major concepts are illustrated with running examples, and major algorithms are illustrated by Pascal computer programs. No prior knowledge of GAs or genetics is assumed, and only a minimum of computer programming and mathematics background is required. 0201157675B07092001]]></book_description>
