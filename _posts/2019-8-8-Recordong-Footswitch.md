# I got a Tascam recorder
And it has a simple footswitch capability to start and stop recording.
I was thinking of getting one, and them I remembered my *big red button*.

As I said...

I drilled a 12mm hole in the box

Soldered the audio plug to wires. It's quite a tight fit.

I tightend the audio plug with a washer, and squeezwd into between the two
*throws* of the switch (one of which we'll be using)

And connected the wires to the NO (normally open) poles of the switch.

Then I tested the continuity

And closed it up

And it works. Very happy. Took about 8 minutes to biuld, and a fiver in
parts that I already had.
