I've decided to start documenting my offline activities which fit, broadly speaking, into the following categories:
* Vanity (as in [vanitas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vanitas))
* Geekery ([electronics](https://github.com/sachawheeler/hourglass), [art](https://www.instagram.com/sachawheeler/))
* Laziness ([reading](https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/57934627))

If nothing else, this serves as a warning to others.
