# A playlist for my funeral

To be clear, I'm perfectly healthy, but I'm also over 50, so let's not kid
ourselves...

<iframe allow="autoplay *; encrypted-media *;" frameborder="0" height="450" style="width:100%;max-width:660px;overflow:hidden;background:transparent;" sandbox="allow-forms allow-popups allow-same-origin allow-scripts allow-storage-access-by-user-activation allow-top-navigation-by-user-activation" src="https://embed.music.apple.com/gb/playlist/funeral/pl.u-qayMsjEb52"></iframe>

Assuming there's no hurry for this, I'll add to it over time.

# Thoughts
That was a really fun way of spending a weekend, listening to all of one's
favourite songs. Do likewise, whether or not you care what they hear at your funeral.

# It's currently over 7 hours long
So come early...
