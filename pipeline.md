title: Other projects

Many projects I start are not finished, and they are often abandoned for better
reasons than they are started.  Much is learned from unsuccessful projects.

What I'm saying is these might never appear.

Currently sitting on shelves:
* a simple single channel digital radio for my father (who has Alzheimer's)
* an 8x8x8 led cube - paused as I think of the application for it.
        I had wanted to reproduce in the led cube whatever is placed in a
        related box (of similar size); a 3d scanner of sorts.  But I haven't
        figured out how to implement the *scanning* part of the project.
* ~~a USB controller for my main audio recording mac~~ [finished]({% post_url 2019-2-20-Audio-Recording-Controller %})
* a small (keyring) GPS tracker for my father with a decent battery life (7 days)
* a CD player for my father with only an eject button and a volume knob.
* a movie to coffee-table book converter. I've had some [success](http://www.blurb.com/b/5786531-coffee-table-book-of-the-living-dead-by-george-rom), but want more.
* a sentient human skull (<span style="color:red;">currently under development</span>)
* a cigar box violin
